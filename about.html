<h2>The Actor of a Thousand Faces</h2><br><br>
<h3>"I don't consider any film of mine bad. I give all my films the importance they deserve. I look at all my roles with the same kind of seriousness."<br><br>
"Hard work and only hard work has paid off for me. Being a very small industry, hard work is a must. It has worked wonders for me most of the time."<br><br>
"I am a person who entered the movie industry with the thought that I wanted to be at least like Marlon Brando. I was never a born actor; I became an actor by acting and acting."<br><br>
